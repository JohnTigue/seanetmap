# Seattle Perf Maps

This directory contains GeoJSON (and maybe TopoJSON) maps of Seattle
NDT results.  The results are aggregated in time and space.  The time
aspect is `by-month` and the space aspect is various map partitions,
either political boundaries (e.g. City Council District, US Census
blocks) or regular geometric shapes (e.g. hex grid).

These files are normally generated by bq2geojson, a Node based CLI
tool which converts bq (Google's Big Query CLI tool) results (CSVs)
into GeoJSON (maybe TopoJSON).

These are generated files i.e. not really source files so normally would
not belong in a source repo. They are included here because generating
them can be time consuming. By providing dev environments these files
pre-generated, a running instance can be up and running quickly.

In a production deploy context these file should be in a CDN.

These files were copied on 2015-05-09 from:

TODO: these total about 51 Meg. Perhaps the set could be whittled down to something a
lot smaller yet still sufficient for testing
